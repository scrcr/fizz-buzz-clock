# FizzBuzzClock

## It's useless clock.
This is a clock that displays the current time based on the rules of Fizz Buzz.

For example, if the second hand points to a number divisible by 3.
this watch will display "Fizz". 
Also, if you can divide by 5, "Buzz". 
And if it is divisible by 15 it will display "Fizz Buzz".
